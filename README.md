# MongoDB_SocialMediaAPI
AS A social media startup I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Description



Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This project is heavily reliant on MongoDB as a backend Database and uses API calls to update the database.  This was a relatively challenging project as there are a lot of small minor details that had to be just right.  For example, when testing, I spelled something incorrectly and had to walk through all of my code again to figure out what went wrong.  I then found out it was my post route, I spelled my column name wrong.

I think this assignment will be very beneficial moving forward.
